# GeostatsPy Python Package for Spatial Data Analytics and Geostatistics Demonstration Workflows 

Often when I use a brandnew Python package I have issues getting started. The one thing that I really appreciate is demonstration examples for common workflows with the package! So to help folks use GeostatsPy I developed well-documented workflows for all the common workflows that use all the functionality in the GeostatsPy package. I hope this is helpful. 

Firstly, if you haven't installed GeostatsPy, here's the GitHub repository [GeostatsPy GitHub](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy/tree/master). GeostatsPy is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) [GeostatsPy PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geostatspy/).

To install GeostatsPy, use pip

pip install geostatspy

Here's some more informaton about GeostatsPy.

The GeostatsPy Package brings GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) functions to Python. GSLIB is a practical and extremely robust set of code for building spatial modeling workflows. 

I created the GeostatsPy Package to support my students in my **Data Analytics**, **Geostatistics** and **Machine Learning** courses. I find my students benefit from hands-on opportunities, in fact it is hard to imagine teaching these topics without providing the opportunity to handle the numerical methods and build workflows. Last year, I tried to have them use the original FORTRAN executables and even with support and worked out examples, it was an uphill battle. In addition, all my students and I are now working in Python for our research. Thus, having access to geostatistical methods in Python directly impacts and facilitates the research of my group. 

Finally, I like to code. I have over 25 years of experience in FORTRAN, C++ and Visual Basic programing. This includes frontend (Qt interfaces in C++) and backend development with small and at times very large engineering and geoscience projects. 

### What's Included

This package contains 2 parts:

1. **geostatspy.geostats** includes GSLIB functions rewritten in Python. This currently includes all the variogram, distribution transformations, and spatial estimation and simulation (SGSIM soon) methods. I will continue adding functions to support modeling operations for practical subsurface model cosntruction. 

2. **geostatspy.GSLIB** includes reimplimentation of the GSLIB visualizations and low tech wrappers of the numerical methods  (note: the low-tech wrapper require access to GSLIB executables).

### Package Dependencies

The functions rely on the following packages:

1. **numpy** - for ndarrays
2. **pandas** - for DataFrames
3. **numpy.linalg** - for linear algebra
4. **numba** - for numerical speed up
5. **scipy** - for fast nearest neighbor search
6. **matplotlib.pyplot** - for plotting
7. **tqdm** - for progress bar
8. **statsmodels** - for weighted (debiased) statistics                

These packages should be available with any modern Python distribution (e.g. https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

If you get a package import error, you may have to first install some of these packages. This can usually be accomplished by opening up a command window on Windows and then typing 'python -m pip install [package-name]'. More assistance is available with the respective package docs.  

### Explanation of GeostatsPy

GeostatsPy includes functions that run 2D workflows from GSLIB in Python (i.e. low tech wrappers), Python translations and reimplementations of GSLIB methods, along with utilities to move between GSLIB's Geo-EAS data sets and Pandas DataFrames, and grids and 2D NumPy ndarrays respectively and other useful operations such as resampling from regular datasets and rescaling distributions.  

The reimplementations as of now include NSCORE, GAM, GAMV, VMODEL, DECLUS, KB2D, IK2D and SGSIM etc. and most of the visualizations using the standard GSLIB parametric inputs and matplotlib back end. The low tech wrappers simply write the GSLIB parameters, run the GSLIB executables and then read in the GSLIB output. This allows for construction of Python workflows with the very robust GSLIB programs.

#### Why make this package? 

I wanted a set of functions to utilize the very robust and numerically efficient GSLIB: Geostatistical Library (Deutsch and Journel, 1998) in Python. While there are other current solutions in Python, I found that these solutions are either proprietary (not open source), not maintained or missing vital functionality; therefore, I have not been able to use these other solutions to teach modeling workflows to students with little or no programming experience. Imagine getting 55 undergraduate students to resort back to a previous version of Python because a single dependency of an available package is not available in a current Python version. Image a student about to submit an assignment, and the code won't run immediately before submission because of an update to a dependency. I need methods for my students that just work, are reliable and do not require students to complete a more complicated environment setup.

Deutsch and Journel (1998) gave the community GSLIB, an extremely robust and flexible set of tools to build spatial modeling workflows. I have spent almost 20 years working with GSLIB along with a wide variety of subsurface modeling software. The powerful flexibility of GSLIB may be lost in methods that attempt to 'can' the inputs and parameters into complicated and hard to work with objects or attempt to combine the programs into a single program. I love open source for teaching the theory because students must see under the hood! The concept of basic building blocks and simple, common inputs is essential to GSLIB. I tried to preserve this by putting together functions with the same conventions as GSLIB, the result is a set of functions that (1) are practical for my students to use and (2) will move the GSLIB veterans into Python workflow construction. Honestly, I did nothing original, but that was my intention.  

I'm a very busy new professor, I'll keep adding more functionality as I have time.

#### More on GSLIB

The GSLIB source is available from GSLIB.com. If you would like to get the executables, ready to use without any need to compile them, go to GSLIB.com for Windows and Linux. I failed to find any Mac OS X executables so my Ph.D. student Wendi Liu compiled them for us (thank you Wendi!) and we have posted them here https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GSLIB_MacOS. If folks on Windows are encountering missing DLL's, I could post static builds. Wendi provided instructions to help Mac users with missing DLL issues at that same location above.

#### Making Images 

The graphical / visualization methods have 2 variants. '_ST' specifies that function is suitable for building subplots (stacked / combined images) while those without '_ST' are for stand-alone images (an image is returned with the function call and an image file is saved in the working directory). The resolution and image file type are specified at the top of the GeostatPy.GSLIB functions.   

#### Assistance Welcome

Found an issue (I'm sure there are issues!)? Got a new idea? Want to work on this? Let me know, submit revisions, I'm happy to collaborate.

### Package Examples

There are many example workflow examples available on my GitHub account at https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/, specifically the GeostatsPy https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy and PythonNumericalDemos  https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos repositories. Most of these examples simply placed the code for the required functions directly in the Jupyter notebook. These were made before this Package was made as I was developing all the functions individually. To use these examples just make these modifications:

1. install geostatspy with the command *pip install geostatspy*. I used the terminal Anaconda Navigator under the environments tab to make sure the package was accessible to Jupyter Notebooks.  
2. add *import geostatspy.GSLIB as GSLIB* and *import geostatspy.geostats as geostats* to the top of the workflow 
3. add *GSLIB.* or *geostats.* as a 'prefex to the GeostatsPy functions based on which set they belong to.

Over the next month I will update all workflows to use the geostatspy package instead of pasting code into the workflows. 

Here's a simple exaple of declustering with the geostatspy package. It looks long because we include making a synthetic dataset, dropping samples to impose a sampling bias, declustering and all the visualization and diagnostics.

plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.0, bottom=0.0, right=2.0, top=3.5, wspace=0.2, hspace=0.2)
plt.show()

```
I also have various lecture notes, demonstrations and example workflows on GitHub (see link below), and some tutorials on my YouTube channel (see link below). I will continue to add more.  I'm just getting started,
